# Get started

Maiton UI is a components library which will simplify your Frames development.
It's inspired by shadcn, so to install a component, for example `Text`, simply run:

```sh
npx maiton-ui add Text
```

You will find the new component in the `/frames/components` directory.

Then, you can import it and start using right away.

Check the [Text](/components/text#usage) page for some usage examples.
